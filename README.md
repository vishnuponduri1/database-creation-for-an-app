# Darshan App Database Project

## Introduction
In the realm of spiritual devotion and religious practices, the Darshan App stands as a radiant guiding star, offering a comprehensive platform for the spiritually inclined populace of India. However, as the app has evolved into a treasure trove of spiritual insights, its reliance on a legacy database system, primarily Microsoft Excel, has become a limitation. This project aims to develop a structured and dynamic database system that can cater to the diverse needs of Darshan and its users.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to create a sophisticated and versatile database that can efficiently manage the vast array of resources provided by Darshan, including deity directories, festival calendars, and sacred scriptures. The current reliance on Microsoft Excel is hindering the app's growth, and a more robust solution is needed to offer a seamless and user-centric experience.

## Benefits of the New Database
1. **Improved User Experience:** The new database will enable Darshan to offer a more seamless and user-centric experience. Devotees can easily access information on upcoming festivals, temple locations, and sacred scriptures.

2. **Increased SEO:** By utilizing the database to enhance content, Darshan can improve its SEO ranking. Including information about related festivals, puranas, and scriptures in articles will make the Darshan website more informative and relevant to search engine users.

3. **New Features:** The database will empower Darshan to develop new features such as a festival calendar and a push notification system. Personalized recommendations based on devotee interests and a knowledge base of spiritual wisdom are among the new possibilities.

The ERD represents the relationships between entities:
- A festival can have many scriptures.
- A festival can celebrate many gods.
- A scripture can be associated with many festivals.
- A scripture can be associated with many gods.
- A god can be associated with many temples.
- A god can be celebrated in various festivals.
- A god can be associated with many scriptures.
- A temple can have many gods.
- A temple can be reached by various transport options.
- A transport station can be the starting point of many temples.

The ERD provides a clear visual representation of the relational schema, ensuring data relationships are maintained with precision. Referential integrity constraints and functional dependencies guarantee the consistency and reliability of the database.

## Conclusion
This project signifies a pivotal step in Darshan's journey, transitioning from a legacy system to a modern and dynamic database infrastructure. The new database will not only address current limitations but also pave the way for innovative features and an enhanced spiritual experience for Darshan's users.
